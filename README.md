# Molmil

Molmil is a WebGL based molecular viewer which can load various formats including PDB, mmCIF and PDBML. Molmil can display small to large structures in high quality as well as scale up to extremely large structures as found in the PDB.

Molmil is currently used by <a target="_blank" href="http://pdbj.org">Protein Data Bank Japan</a> as one of the available molecular viewers, as well as for the generation of the PDB images used by the <a target="_blank" href="http://pdbj.org/mine/search?query=*">PDBj Mine service</a>.

The source code of Molmil is available under the LGPLv3 licence (see LICENCE.md).
A usable version of Molmil is available at http://gjbekker.github.io/molmil/ and basic usage is described at https://github.com/gjbekker/molmil/wiki/Molmil-usage.
